# This is a series of OOP exercises in Java that I'm doing.
Just to put the concepts into practice.

# PROBLEMS

1 - Write a programm to read the width and height values of a rectangle. In the next, print the value of its area, perimeter and diagonal.

2 - Write a programm to read employee data {name, gross salary and tax}. next, show the employee data {name and net salary}. After that, increase the employee salary based on the given percentage {only gross salary is affected by the percentage} and again, show the employee data.

3 - Write a program to read the student's name and the 3rd grade they got for the entire quarter. (the maximum value for the first quarter is 30 and 35 for the remainder). then, show the student's final grade for the year. You must say whether the student passed or failed (above 60%). In case of failure, show how many points are left for the student to pass. 

its good for training your logic too :D
